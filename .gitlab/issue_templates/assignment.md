## Assignment: Description

* TA-2019-3
* A walking-robot to assist rehabilitation as part of walking-therapy procedure in the hospital.
* Develop the architecture needed for the development process of the product.
* Product needs to be able to provide full or partial walking support.
* Product needs to be able to adapt to the needs of neurologically challenged patients, especially in the acute-phase.

## What is needed?

* A walking-robot.
* Needs to be robotically assisted, and have mechanically adjustable orthosis.
* Among other things the walking robotg requires orthosis, runningmat and weight-lightening system.

#Technical and quality requirements:

* Product needs to meet the legal criteria of healthcare-propducts and the modifications done to it, as well as the requirements of the officials set for health-care products.
* Product needs to be meet the work - and safety requirements detailed in Finnish policies.
* Product have to be CE-marked.
* Product has to have a dynamic weight-lightening system, which needs to be controllable with a remote.
* Product has to come with 4 pieces of harnesses that offer different sizes. Sizes have to be class S, M, L, XL or corresponding:
* To get to the running-mat needs to be easy and accessible with a wheelchair using a ramp.
* Needs to be able to support patients weighting 130 kg and allow a 200 cm tall patient use of the product.

# Walking-lightening function requirements:

* Product needs to be able to adapt to walk-lightening walking-therapy with robot assistance, as well as practice without robot assitance.
* Needs to have a virtual biofeedback-software and a screen or some other technical solution.
* Product needs to be able to adapt to varying functionality-level of the patient.
* Need to be able to measure following: distance, muscle activity, muscle density/resistance, lower-limb motion-frequency and isometric impetus.
* Has to be able to save at least 10 or more patients measuring results and exercise history.
* For future documentation (records have to be be able to be printed).
* Product has to be able to mechanically direct and simulate the sideways-movement of the hip and hip rotation.

# Product needs to have computerconnected and forcesensory equipped lowerlimb-orthosis which allow the following:

* Roboautomation which directs and simulates normal walking-model preventing mechanical lower limb overstretching, for example in the kneejoints.
* Adapts fully to plegic one-sided paralysis patient walking-therapy exercise when the system has to have the required automation which allows the adjustement of the number of supports from fully supported to free independent exercise.
* Allows paralayzed lower limb function direction for the full length from hip joint to ankle; in addition it has supports for the foot.
* Has to be able to be mechanically, symmetrically and unsymmetrically modifiable to the hips and knee caps motion frequency.

#Regarding usage: 

* Patient specific, individualistic modification (example: orthosis, runningmat, weight-lightening), the firmness and robustness.
* The device safety (does it have automatic emergency-shutdown switch).
* Ability to utilize informationtechnical applications (printable information file format and device connected biofeedback development possibilities).
* Possible virtual environment options and their versatility.
* Automatic spasm detection, automatic relaxation function or some other similar solution.
* Offered product has to be fully functional and usable for the intended usage.
* The product supplier is responsible for the safety of the product during the trial.
